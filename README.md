Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains some terraform templates that I have worked on in the past that deploy resources in the AWS cloud. Feel free to use them or create a PR to contribute to this repository. As with all templates in this repository, they might not be updated to work with the latest version of AWS's resources, please check before deploying them.<br><br>

## API Gateway

### API Gateway with S3 Integration (API-GATEWAY-S3)
This template deploys an API Gateway which allows for files to be uploaded to a S3 bucket via a PUT request. Once deployed the file can be uploaded by making a PUT request to API Gateway's URL eg, "https://API_GATEWAY_URL/file_upload/some_file.txt". In this case, the file will be uploaded to the S3 bucket with the filename of some_file.txt. There is no API key or security for this gateway, do consider that before deploying this. For more information on the integration between S3 and API Gateway, check [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/integrating-api-with-aws-services-s3.html)<br><br>
